Implemented state-of-the-art methods in event extraction and natural language processing in order to predict stock price movements from news. Extracted event tuples from news articles using Open IE, and used FastText to obtain word embeddings. Applied a deep Convolutional Neural Network to capture interactions between short-term and long-term events, and obtained an improvement over previous methods.
