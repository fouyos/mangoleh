Reconstructed a real-world train network from entry and exit data using NetworkX. Applied a Weighted MST algorithm to construct a tree, and optimized the algorithm to add back cycles.

Note: The data is not open, so I am unable to share the code. I am happy, however, to share any insights from this.
