Zero-shot learning involves making a neural network that can recognize images from classes that were never seen before. Applied SIFT and ResNet101 for feature extraction and applied a relation network to combine the attribute vector with the image feature vector. Achived a significant increase in accuracy with ResNet101 + Relation Network.
